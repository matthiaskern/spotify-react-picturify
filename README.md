# Example react app using  flux and the Spotify api
with the help of react-babel-webpack-boilerplate, spotify-web-api-js and Vibrant.js.

At the moment, the picture input is analyzed and the most prominent color is compared to a fixed table of colors with genres.

I came up with this idea, while reading about synesthesia.
A little bit better approach would be to search for tracks based on the key signature of it, but Spotify doesnt calculate that data.

[Example](https://matthiaskern.github.io/spotify-react-picturify/)
```
npm install
npm start
```
